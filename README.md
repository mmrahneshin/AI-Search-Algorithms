# AI Search Algorithms

A collection of Java implementations for classic AI search algorithms, including:

- A* Search (ASTAR)
- Bidirectional Search (BDS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)
- Iterative Deepening A* Search (IDASTAR)

## Features

- Modular design with reusable components (`core`, `model`, `AI` packages).
- Includes sample test cases for validating algorithms (`test-case/`).
- Suitable for educational purposes and AI research.

## Getting Started

1. Compile and run the Java files in the `src-java/` directory.
2. Use the provided test cases for input examples.
